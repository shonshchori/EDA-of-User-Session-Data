# Exploring User Behavior on an E-commerce Website: An EDA of User Session Data

## part of Advanced Data Mining and Analysis in Python Course

**In this exercise, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset that contains information regarding user sessions on an e-commerce website.**  

Our analysis will involve addressing the presence of **missing values**, as well as **optimizing data types**, in order to facilitate the creation of new variables that provide additional insights into the data.  

To this end, we will leverage the existing data to **engineer new columns** that will augment our understanding of the dataset.
